# ATmega328P LED Blink with Timer Delay

This project demonstrates how to blink an LED with a **1-second delay** on the **ATmega328P** (Arduino UNO MCU) using **hardware timers** with prescalers instead of software loops.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup
- **Microcontroller**: ATmega328P @ 16 MHz (Arduino UNO compatible)
- **LED**: Onboard LED at **PB5 (Arduino digital pin 13)**

---

## üìÇ Project Files
- `main_timer0.c` ‚Üí Uses **Timer0** (8-bit) with prescaler = 1024  
- `main_timer1.c` ‚Üí Uses **Timer1** (16-bit) with prescaler = 1024 (simpler & recommended)

---

## üìù Code Explanation

### Timer0 Version
- Prescaler = 1024 ‚Üí each tick = 64 ¬µs  
- Timer0 (8-bit) overflows every `256 √ó 64 ¬µs = 16.384 ms`  
- To get 1s, we need about **61 overflows**

```c
void delay_1s(void)
{
    TCCR0A = 0x00;
    TCCR0B = (1 << CS02) | (1 << CS00);  // Prescaler = 1024

    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 61; i++)
    {
        TCNT0 = 0;                       // Reset counter
        while (!(TIFR0 & (1 << TOV0)));  // Wait for overflow
        TIFR0 |= (1 << TOV0);            // Clear flag
    }

    TCCR0B = 0; // Stop timer
}
````

---

### Timer1 Version (Recommended)

* Prescaler = 1024 ‚Üí tick = 64 ¬µs
* Timer1 (16-bit) overflows every `65536 √ó 64 ¬µs = 4.19 s`
* For 1s, just wait until `TCNT1` reaches **15625**

```c
void delay_1s(void)
{
    TCCR1A = 0x00;
    TCCR1B = (1 << CS12) | (1 << CS10);  // Prescaler = 1024
    TCNT1 = 0;                           // Reset counter

    while (TCNT1 < 15625);               // 1 second delay

    TCCR1B = 0;                          // Stop timer
}
```

Nice ‚Äî I‚Äôll walk through your exact file **line-by-line**, explain what each statement does, point out mistakes, and show small fixes where needed. I‚Äôll also finish with a corrected **Timer0** version that keeps your original approach but actually works.

# Line-by-line explanation (with notes & fixes)

**Comment block**

```c
/*
 * GccApplication1.c
 *
 * Created: 17-09-2025 20:48:45
 * Author : sreer
 */
```

* Plain file header comments. No effect on compilation ‚Äî just metadata.

**CPU frequency macro**

```c
#define F_CPU 16000000L
```

* Defines the CPU clock frequency as `16,000,000 Hz`. Many AVR libraries (e.g. `_delay_ms()` in `<util/delay.h>`) use this macro to compute delays.
* **Note:** prefer `16000000UL` (unsigned long) ‚Äî `L` works but `UL` is more explicit.

**I/O header**

```c
#include <avr/io.h>
```

* Pulls in all the register and bit definitions for your target MCU (e.g. `PORTB`, `TCCR0A`, `TIFR0`, `CS00`, etc.). Required to access hardware registers by name.

---

**Function declaration**

```c
void delay_1s(void)
{
```

* Starts a function named `delay_1s` returning `void` and taking no parameters. The intent: produce a \~1 second delay using Timer0.

**Local variables**

```c
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int count=62500;
```

* `unsigned int` on AVR-GCC is **16 bits**, range `0..65535`. `62500` fits.
* `count = 62500` is intended to represent the number of Timer0 overflows you need to accumulate \~1 s when Timer0 runs with **no prescaler**:

  * Calculation: Timer tick = 16 MHz / 1 = 16,000,000 ticks/sec
    Timer0 is 8-bit ‚áí overflow after 256 ticks ‚Üí 16,000,000 / 256 = **62,500 overflows/sec**
    ‚Üí so `count = 62,500` approximates 1 second.

**for loop**

```c
    for (i=0;i<count;i++)
    {
```

* Loop `count` times. Each iteration is supposed to wait one Timer0 overflow.

**reset timer counter**

```c
    TCNT0 = 0;
```

* Sets Timer0 counter to 0. Good: you want the timer to count from zero to overflow each iteration.

**clear TCCR0A**

```c
    TCCR0A = 0;
```

* This writes zero to Timer/Counter Control Register A for Timer0 (WGM bits, COM bits). That clears waveform generation and compare output modes.
* **Unclear intent:** It's unusual to clear `TCCR0A` inside every loop iteration. Usually you configure control registers once, outside the loop.

**set prescaler (WRONG register)**

```c
    TCCR0A |= (1 << CS00);
```

* **This is wrong.** The `CS00` (clock select) bit for Timer0 is **not** in `TCCR0A` ‚Äî it is in **`TCCR0B`** on ATmega328P. Writing `(1<<CS00)` to `TCCR0A` has no effect on starting/stopping the timer.
* **Correct action:** set `TCCR0B |= (1 << CS00);` (or `TCCR0B = (1<<CS00);`), once before the loop if you want prescaler = 1 (no prescale).

**wait for overflow**

```c
    while (!(TIFR0 & (1 << TOV0)))
    {
        
    }
```

* Busy-waits until the Timer0 Overflow Flag (`TOV0`) is set in `TIFR0` ‚Äî i.e. until the timer overflows.
* **Important:** reading `TIFR0 & (1<<TOV0)` is fine, but **you must clear the flag** after detecting it. On AVR you clear many flags by writing a `1` to the same bit: `TIFR0 |= (1 << TOV0);`
* **Bug in your code:** you never clear `TOV0`. Consequence:

  * First iteration: `TOV0` goes from 0‚Üí1 and the `while` exits (good).
  * Next iteration: because `TOV0` is still `1`, the `while` condition `!(TIFR0 & (1<<TOV0))` is **false immediately**, so the code **does not wait** for the next overflow and progresses instantly. Result: you get only one overflow delay total (not 62,500), so the function **does not** produce 1 second.

**closing braces**

```c
    }
}
```

* Close `for` loop and `delay_1s` function. (Function ends without having properly started the timer or cleared flags.)

---

**`main` function**

```c
int main(void)
{
    /* Replace with your application code */
    while (1)
    { 
        PORTB |= (1 << PORTB5);
        delay_1s();
        PORTB &= ~(1 << PORTB5);
        delay_1s();
        //portb^=(1<<PORTB5); xor
    }
}
```

* `main()` enters an infinite loop that:

  1. sets bit `PORTB5` high (turn LED on),
  2. calls `delay_1s()`,
  3. clears `PORTB5` (turn LED off),
  4. calls `delay_1s()` again.

**Important missing piece:** you never set PB5 as an **output**. You should set the Data Direction Register:

```c
DDRB |= (1 << DDB5);  // configure PB5 as output
```

* Without this, writes to `PORTB` will enable/disable pull-ups if the pin is configured input ‚Äî the LED won't behave as expected.

**Comment about XOR**

```c
//portb^=(1<<PORTB5); xor
```

* Suggesting `PORTB ^= (1 << PORTB5);` toggles PB5 in one instruction. That‚Äôs fine if PB5 is an output.

---

# Summary of bugs / problems in this file

1. **Wrong register for prescaler**: `CS00` set in `TCCR0A` ‚Äî should be `TCCR0B`.
2. **TOV0 never cleared**: must clear overflow flag after detecting it (`TIFR0 |= (1 << TOV0);`). Otherwise only the first loop waits.
3. **TCCR0A is repeatedly zeroed inside the loop** ‚Äî configuration should be done once.
4. **PB5 not set as output** in `main()` ‚Äî add `DDRB |= (1<<DDB5);`.
5. The chosen method (62,500 iterations of waiting an 8-bit overflow) is **inefficient** and vulnerable to timing errors from loop overhead; Timer1 (16-bit) or CTC mode would be cleaner.

---

# Minimal corrected Timer0 version (keeps your overflow-count idea)

This fixes the register bit placement and clears the overflow flag properly:

```c
#define F_CPU 16000000UL
#include <avr/io.h>

void delay_1s(void)
{
    const unsigned int count = 62500;
    // Normal mode (TCCR0A = 0), set prescaler = 1 in TCCR0B
    TCCR0A = 0x00;
    TCCR0B = (1 << CS00);        // Start timer with no prescaler

    // Clear any pending overflow
    TIFR0 |= (1 << TOV0);

    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
    {
        TCNT0 = 0;                       // start counting from 0
        while (!(TIFR0 & (1 << TOV0))) ; // wait for overflow
        TIFR0 |= (1 << TOV0);            // clear overflow flag
    }

    // Stop timer
    TCCR0B = 0x00;
}

int main(void)
{
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB5);   // make PB5 an output
    while (1)
    {
        PORTB ^= (1 << PORTB5); // toggle LED
        delay_1s();
    }
}
```

**Notes on this corrected Timer0 approach**

* This will work *in principle*, but it is inefficient because it needs 62,500 software loop iterations. The function call overhead + the while-checks add a small extra time per iteration ‚Äî the total delay will differ slightly from exactly 1 s.
* A better approach: use **Timer1 (16-bit)** with prescaler 1024 and wait for `TCNT1 >= 15625` (one compare), or use **CTC mode** and `OCR0A`/`OCR1A` compare match interrupts/mode to get accurate delays with far less CPU overhead. I showed a Timer1 example earlier if you want it.

---

If you want, I can:

* show a corrected **Timer1** implementation again (even more concise),
* show a **CTC (compare match)** version for Timer0 (no large loops), or
* run through exact timing error estimates caused by the C loop overhead.

Which of those would you like next?

### Main Loop (common for both)

```c
int main(void)
{
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB5);   // PB5 output

    while (1)
    {
        PORTB ^= (1 << PORTB5); // Toggle LED
        delay_1s();             // Wait 1 second
    }
}
```

## üìä Comparison

| Timer  | Prescaler | Overflows Needed | Simplicity |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Timer0 | 1024      | 61               | More code  |
| Timer1 | 1024      | 1                | ‚úÖ Cleaner  |

---

## üöÄ Recommendation

For simple **1s LED blinks**, use **Timer1 with prescaler 1024**.
Timer0 is better for **short delays** (e.g., \~10‚Äì100 ms).

```

üëâ Do you want me to include **both `.c` files** (`main_timer0.c` and `main_timer1.c`) inside the README (like code blocks), or keep them as **separate source files** with just references in the README?
